# Portfolio

## Description

The main goal of this site was to have a space where I can display and describe my favorites projects, other than experiment more with desing, animation and small interactions.<br/>
During the development I've learned how to manage the scrolling, wheel and touch event in Vanilla JavaScript. I also improved in animation and user interaction design.
